Final 1

Earlier in the year we were given a formula to compute Pi by using the perimeter of an n-sded polygon. The original code had issues with accuracy due to floating point number calculations. Issues arise when the numerator contains subtraction and when the calculation approaches zero. When forumla computers the number 1 minus 'x' it matters how close that 'x' value is to 1. For very large n values this number 'x' will become very large and therefore impact precision. The formula is fixed by assuring that this 'x' number does not vary too far from zero and cause for the loss in precision.
